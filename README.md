Here's an application where users can bet money and a color and see if they won against the casino.

## Hows It's Made:

Made using HTML, CSS, Javascript, Node.js, JSON, Express, EJS, MongoDB.

Theres an admin login that they can see who if the user won or lost and the change of money. When the reset button is clicked,
it removes the data from the database. After that, the page is reloaded. This allows for the admin's information to be updated
simply through methods.
